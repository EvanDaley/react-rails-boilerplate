# react-rails-boilerplate

## Description

This is a simple boilerplate react/rails app. This includes:

1. frontend project generated with `npx create-react-app frontend`
2. backend project generated with `rails new backend`
3. A simple docker-compose setup.

Additionally, for convenience, I've installed the following:

NPM Packages:
1. 
2.
3.

Gems:

## Setup
```

```
